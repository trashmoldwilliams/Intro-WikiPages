# Wiki Pages

#### By Will Johnson

## Description

A Wikipedia clone for computer science terms created for Intro to Programming. The key focus here was creating a site with many pages, but it also served as a review for all the concepts up to this point. It is largely unfinished in terms of definitions, but the large focus was the site structure.
